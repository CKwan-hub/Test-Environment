# Test-Environment
Test environment for Credential Generator to see submitted data for further optimization and tweaks. 

## Notes:
Rough rendition of a login page. 
Data sent via email and password form fields denoted as 'email' and 'password' to 'users' table in 'login' SQL database via phpMyAdmin hosted locally.

## TODO: 
Analyze better "true random" password generation. 
Work on performance for generation.
Create option to send "bad data" or incorrectly formatted email/password for validation testing.
